# ðŸ“š Welcome to the RAG Workshop! ðŸŽ‰


## Introduction
Hi everyone,

I'm Dina Bavli, and I'm excited to welcome you to the upcoming RAG workshop! To help you get the most out of the session, I've prepared some introductory resources to familiarize yourself with the key concepts.

## ðŸ“– Introductory Resources

### For those with no prior data science background:
I've created a blog post that introduces essential terms and concepts in a clear and intuitive way. This will help establish a common language for the workshop and ensure everyone feels comfortable participating.

### For those with some data science knowledge:
I've adapted an introductory document from the WiDS Fine-Tuning workshop. This resource dives deeper into the historical context and basic functionalities of language models, culminating in the introduction of transformers. This will serve as an enrichment resource for those who want to refresh their understanding before the workshop.

### 3. Google Colaboratory:
We'll be using Google Colaboratory for our coding exercises. A quick guide to getting started with Colaboratory can be found here: [Google Colaboratory Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/). Please ensure you have it, and refrain from using it before the workshop if you're not familiar with it. Save your computing resources for the workshop.

### 4. Hugging Face Account and API Token:
We'll also be utilizing Hugging Face, a popular platform for sharing and accessing machine learning models. You'll need to create a free account on Hugging Face and obtain an API token.
